    StringChallenge(strArr) take the strArr parameter being passed, which will only contain a single element, and return the string true if it is a valid number that contains only digits with properly placed decimals and commas, otherwise return the string false. For example: if strArr is ["1,093,222.04"] then your program should return the string true, but if the input were ["1,093,22.04"] then your program should return the string false. The input may contain characters other than digits.

    ArrayChallenge(arr) take the array of positive integers stored in arr and return the length of the longest consecutive subsequence (LCS). An LCS is a subset of the original list where the numbers are in sorted order, from lowest to highest, and are in a consecutive, increasing order. The sequence does not need to be contiguous and there can be several different subsequences. For example: if arr is [4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 6, 100, 9] then a few consecutive sequences are [1, 2, 3, 4], and [8, 9]. For this input, your program should return 4 because that is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence.
