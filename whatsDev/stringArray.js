// StringChallenge(strArr) take the strArr parameter being passed, which will only contain a single element, and return the string true if it is a valid number that contains only digits with properly placed decimals and commas, otherwise return the string false. For example: if strArr is ["1,093,222.04"] then your program should return the string true, but if the input were ["1,093,22.04"] then your program should return the string false. The input may contain characters other than digits.

// ArrayChallenge(arr) take the array of positive integers stored in arr and return the length of the longest consecutive subsequence (LCS). An LCS is a subset of the original list where the numbers are in sorted order, from lowest to highest, and are in a consecutive, increasing order. The sequence does not need to be contiguous and there can be several different subsequences. For example: if arr is [4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 6, 100, 9] then a few consecutive sequences are [1, 2, 3, 4], and [8, 9]. For this input, your program should return 4 because that is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence.
