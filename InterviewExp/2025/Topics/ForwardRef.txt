************useImperartiveHandle***********

useImperativeHandle is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref.

useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, dependencies?)

Usage: Exposing a custom ref handle to the parent component

Ref: The ref you received as the second argument from the forwardRef render function.
* createHandle: A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose. That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
