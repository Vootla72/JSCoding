// Position : relative vs absolute
absolute means it will sit at the top

<body>
    <View1>
        <Vieew2>





        <View2>
    </View1>
</body>

Case1:   View1: Width:100%, height:100%
         View2: Width:100%, height:100%, Position:absolute
        
As position is not relative for View1 styles, view2 will sit at the top of body(as body is parent)


Case2:   View1: Width:100%, height:100%, Position:relative
         View2: Width:100%, height:100%, Position:absolute

As position is  relative for View1 styles, view2 will sit at the top of View1(as View1 is parent- relative mentioned)

here we r not able see any difference as width n height are 100%.



Case3:   View1: Width:50%, height:50%, Position:relative
         View2: Width:100%, height:100%, Position:absolute

As position is  relative for View1 styles, view2 will sit at the top of View1(as View1 is parent- relative mentioned)

here parent is 50% so view2 will take 100% wrt to its parent and sit at the top wrt View1

//sticky vs fixed

sticky : toggles between relative n fixed depending on the scroll position. 
It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
you must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.

fixed: the css style position fixed indicates that particular element will be fixed at that position.
