You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Merge two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space

Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order.
Merge them in sorted order. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 
so that it contains the last M elements.




///////////////////////sol/////////////////////////

// Approach:

// The sizes of the given arrays are n(size of arr1[]) and m(size of arr2[]).

// The steps are as follows:

// We will declare two pointers i.e. left and right. The left pointer will point to the last index of the arr1[](i.e. Basically the maximum element of the array). The right pointer will point to the first index of the arr2[](i.e. Basically the minimum element of the array).
// Now, the left pointer will move toward index 0 and the right pointer will move towards the index m-1. While moving the two pointers we will face 2 different cases like the following:
// If arr1[left] > arr2[right]: In this case, we will swap the elements and move the pointers to the next positions.
// If arr1[left] <= arr2[right]: In this case, we will stop moving the pointers as arr1[] and arr2[] are containing correct elements.
// Thus, after step 2, arr1[] will contain all smaller elements and arr2[] will contain all bigger elements. Finally, we will sort the two arrays.
// Intuition:
// If we merge the given array, one thing we can assure is that arr1[] will contain all the smaller elements and arr2[] will contain all the bigger elements. This is the logic we will use. Using the 2 pointers, we will swap the bigger elements of arr1[] with the smaller elements of arr2[] until the minimum of arr2[] becomes greater or equal to the maximum of arr1[].



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void merge(long long arr1[], long long arr2[], int n, int m) {

    //Declare 2 pointers:
    int left = n - 1;
    int right = 0;

    //Swap the elements until arr1[left] is
    // smaller than arr2[right]:
    while (left >= 0 && right < m) {
        if (arr1[left] > arr2[right]) {
            swap(arr1[left], arr2[right]);
            left--, right++;
        }
        else {
            break;
        }
    }

    // Sort arr1[] and arr2[] individually:
    sort(arr1, arr1 + n);
    sort(arr2, arr2 + m);
}

int main()
{
    long long arr1[] = {1, 4, 8, 10};
    long long arr2[] = {2, 3, 9};
    int n = 4, m = 3;
    merge(arr1, arr2, n, m);
    cout << "The merged arrays are: " << "\n";
    cout << "arr1[] = ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr1[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << "\narr2[] = ";
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cout << arr2[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}



// Time Complexity: O(min(n, m)) + O(n*logn) + O(m*logm), where n and m are the sizes of the given arrays.
// Reason: O(min(n, m)) is for swapping the array elements. And O(n*logn) and O(m*logm) are for sorting the two arrays.

// Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
