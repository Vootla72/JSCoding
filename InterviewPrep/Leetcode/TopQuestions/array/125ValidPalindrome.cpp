A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

isalnum ------ is alpha numeric which consists of numbers and letters



///////////////////Approach////////////////
If a character is not alphanumeric we can simply ignore it and update our pointer to next character (for both pointers)

and then we check by converting the alphanumeric character to lowercase (tolower() function on numbers has no change)
if those two are not equal then return false(not palindrome)
else update both pointers and continue.

Finally after all checking if reach at last then string must be a valid palindrome so return true.

Complexity
Time complexity:O(n)
Space complexity:O(1) since only use two pointers

            if(tolower(s[start])!=tolower(s[end]))
            return false;

        }
        return true;
