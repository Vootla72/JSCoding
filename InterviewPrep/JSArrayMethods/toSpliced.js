// ES2023 added the Array toSpliced() method as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array.
// The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array,
//  keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const spliced = months.toSpliced(0, 1);
console.log("to spliced method******", spliced, months);

// spliced: ['Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr'];
// Months: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr']
