1. Core Concepts of React.js:
    * Virtual DOM
    * JSX
    * Components and Props
    * State and Lifecycle Methods
    * Handling Events
    * Conditional Rendering
    * Lists and Keys
    * Forms and Controlled Components
    * Fragments
2. Advanced React Concepts:
    * Higher Order Components (HOCs)
    * Render Props
    * Context API
    * Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
    * Custom Hooks
    * Error Boundaries
    * Memoization and Performance Optimization
3. State Management:
    * Redux (Actions, Reducers, Store, Middleware)
    * Redux Toolkit
    * MobX
    * Context API for state management
    * Comparison of state management libraries
4. Routing:
    * React Router
    * Nested Routes
    * Protected Routes
5. Server-side Rendering (SSR):
    * Next.js
    * Gatsby
6. Testing:
    * Unit Testing with Jest
    * Testing React Components with Enzyme or React Testing Library
    * Integration Testing
7. Advanced Topics:
    * Server-side rendering with React
